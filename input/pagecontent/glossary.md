Below is a glossary of terms used in this implementation guide.

<p></p>

**Data Minimization:** A privacy principle embedded in the Health Cards framework that aims to disclose only the minimum necessary information to verifiers.

**FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources):** A standard for healthcare data exchange that defines how healthcare information can be exchanged between different systems.

**Health Wallet:** An application that enables users to store, manage, and present Health Cards. It allows users to retrieve Health Cards from issuers and selectively share them with verifiers.

**Holder:** The user who stores credentials in their Health Wallet and controls when and with whom to share them.

**Issuer:** An entity (such as a lab, pharmacy, healthcare provider, EHR, public health department, or immunization information system) that generates verifiable credentials with cryptographic signatures.

**JWS (JSON Web Signature):** The technical format used to encode Health Cards with secure digital signatures.

**QR Code:** A machine-readable optical label that can contain Health Card data, allowing for paper-based or digital display of credentials.

**Revocation:** The process of invalidating a previously issued Health Card, which can be done individually using revocation identifiers or by revoking an entire issuing key.

**SHC:** Abbreviation for SMART Health Card.

**SHL:** Abbreviation for SMART Health Link.

**SMART on FHIR:** A set of open specifications that integrate apps with Electronic Health Records, portals, Health Information Exchanges, and other health IT systems.

**SMART Health Card:** A verifiable credential containing signed healthcare data that can be stored and presented by users for various purposes like proving vaccination status or sharing health information.

**SMART Health Link:** An extension of the Health Cards framework that enables storage and sharing of more information than can be kept on a single SMART Health Card (using cloud storage) and provides additional sharing options including limited-time access, long-term sharing of data that can evolve over time, and protecting access with a PIN that can be communicated to the recipient out-of-band.

**Trust Framework:** A set of rules that help verifiers decide which issuers to trust, though SMART Health Cards can operate independently of any specific framework.

**Verifiable Credential (VC):** A tamper-evident credential with authorship that can be cryptographically verified.

**Verifier:** An entity that receives Health Cards from holders/users and validates their cryptographic signatures to ensure authenticity.
