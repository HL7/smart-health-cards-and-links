### Overview

Paper medical records--such as vaccination histories and insurance cards--are easily lost or damaged, are difficult to authenticate, and are often not on-hand when theyâ€™re needed. 

SMART Health Cards and Links are FHIR-based standards that address these challenges, enabling individuals to receive their health information and share it with others in a tamper-proof and verifiable digital form. The standards can also be used to share less sensitive information that doesn't need to be verified by the receiver. They provide a digital version of an individual's clinical information that can be kept at the ready and easily shared with others when the need arises--using a QR code, mobile app or web browser.

Together SMART Health Cards and Links provide options that support multiple goals--from keeping a small amount of verifiable medical information close by to authorizing a trusted party to access their entire medical record. They empower individuals with secure, equitable, and privacy-preserving access to their clinical information.

Examples of what an individual can do using these standards include:

- receive proof of critical immunizations on a physical card or in a mobile app and allow others to verify them by scanning the attached QR code
- using a SMART Health Link to transmit their member ID when checking in at their doctor's office
- send an elementary school a link to their child's immunization history, allowing the school to verify the information with the immunization registry and copy in the details if it wishes
- receive a "ticket" to access the results of a lab test when they're ready
- give a provider time-limited or ongoing access to some or all of their medical data, including the ability to search
- scan a prescription bottle to receive the full prescription details.

### IG Organization
The implementation guide is organized into two sections:

* **SMART Health Cards** describes the protocol that allows an individual to keep a copy of their important health records with them in the form of a secure QR code that may be saved digitally or printed on paper. SMART Health Cards build on international open standards and decentralized infrastructure to provide end-user privacy and the ability to work across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries. This section includes:
  * [Health Cards user stories](cards-user-stories.html) 
  * the formal [Health Cards specification](cards-specification.html)
  * the [Issue Verifiable Credential operation](OperationDefinition-patient-i-health-cards-issue.html) for requesting and generating SMART Health Cards
  * a description of [Health Cards credential modeling](cards-credential-modeling.html)
  * [SMART Health Card examples](cards-examples.html)
  * a [Health Cards FAQ](frequently-asked-questions.html)
  * the historical [log of changes to the SMART Health Cards specification](cards-changelog.html) prior to it becoming an HL7 standard

<p></p>

* **SMART Health Links** describes the protocol that enables storage and sharing of more information than can be kept on a single SMART Health Card (using cloud storage) and provides additional sharing options including limited-time access, long-term sharing of data that can evolve over time, and protecting access with a PIN that can be communicated to the recipient out-of-band. This section contains:
  * [Health Links user stories](links-user-stories.html) 
  * the formal [Health Links specification](links-specification.html)
  * [Health Link examples](links-examples.html)

<p></p>

In addition, there is a **[glossary](glossary.html)** of related terms and abbreviations used throughout the guide.
