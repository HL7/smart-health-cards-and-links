### Overview

Paper medical records--such as vaccination histories and insurance cards--are easily lost or damaged, are difficult to authenticate, and are often not on-hand when theyâ€™re needed. 

SMART Health Cards and Links are FHIR-based standards that address these challenges, enabling individuals to receive their health information and share it with others in a tamper-proof and verifiable digital form.They provide a digital version of an individual's clinical information that can be kept at the ready and easily shared with others when the need arises--using a QR code, mobile app or web browser.


* [SMART Health Cards](cards-user-stories.html) allow an individual to keep a copy of their important health records with them and easily share this information with others. They contain a secure QR code and may be saved digitally or printed on paper. SMART Health Cards build on international open standards and decentralized infrastructure to provide end-user privacy and the ability to work across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries

* [SMART Health Links](links-user-stories.html) add the ability to store and share more information than can be kept on a single SMART Health Card, and provide sharing options including limited-time access, long-term sharing of data that can evolve over time, and protecting access with a PIN that can be communicated to the recipient out-of-band.

Together SMART Health Cards and Links provide options that support multiple goals--from keeping a small amount of verifiable medical information close by to authorizing a trusted party to access their entire medical record. They empower individuals with secure, equitable, and privacy-preserving access to their clinical information.

Examples of what an individual can do using these standards include:

- receive proof of critical immunizations on a physical card or in a mobile app and allow others to verify them by scanning the attached QR code
- scan their insurance card's QR code when checking in at their doctor's office--transmitting their member ID and other coverage information directly to the clinic's system
- send an elementary school a link to their child's immunization history, allowing the school to verify the information with the immunization registry and copy in the details if it wishes
- receive a "ticket" to access the results of a lab test when they're ready
- give a provider time-limited or ongoing access to some or all of their medical data, including the ability to search.
