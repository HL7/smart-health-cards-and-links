### Overview

SMART Health Cards and SMART Health Links are FHIR-based standards that enable patients to receive and share their health information easily and securely using QR codes, mobile apps and web sites. 

Together they provide options that support different patient goals--from keeping a small amount of verifiable medical information on-hand to authorizing a trusted party to access their entire medical record. 

Examples of what an individual can do using SMART Health Cards (Cards) alone or in combination with SMART Links (Links) include:

- receive proof of critical immunizations on a physical card or in a mobile app and allow others to verify them by scanning the attached QR code
- scan their insurance card's QR code when checking in at their doctor's office--transmitting their member ID and other coverage information directly to the clinic's system
- send an elementary school a link to their child's immunization history, allowing the school to verify the information with the immunization registry and copy in the details if it wishes
- receive a "ticket" to access the results of a lab test when they're ready
- give a provider time-limited or ongoing access to some or all of their medical data, including the ability to search.

Cards and Links share technologies for representing, securing and verifying a patient's information and are designed to be used together. This guide defines their features, specifies rules for implementing, and describes scenarios that illustrate their use.
