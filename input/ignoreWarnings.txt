# Figuring out what terminology needs to be in the IG. The current code systems and value sets reflect existing SMART sites/specs. Will address these after we decide what to keep
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
